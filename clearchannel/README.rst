A cog to transfer all messages channel in a other channel!

--------
Commands
--------

Here are all the commands included in this cog (9):

* ``[p]clearchannel [confirmation=False]``
 Delete ALL messages from the current channel by duplicating it and then deleting it.

* ``[p]setclearchannel``
 Configure ClearChannel for your server.

 Specify a custom message to be sent from the link of another message or a json (https://discohook.org/ for example).

* ``[p]setclearchannel deletechannel <delete_channel>``
 If this option is disabled, the bot will not delete the original channel: it will duplicate it as normal, but move it to the end of the server's channel list.

* ``[p]setclearchannel dmauthor <dm_author>``
 If this option is enabled, the bot will try to send a dm to the author of the order to confirm that everything went well.

 If this option is enabled, the bot will send a message to the emptied channel to inform that it has been emptied.

If you haven't added my repo before, lets add it first. We'll call it

    [p]repo add AAA3A-cogs https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/AAA3A-cogs

Now, we can install ClearChannel.
