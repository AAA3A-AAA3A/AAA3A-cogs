# Thanks to @epic guy on Discord for the basic syntax (command groups, commands) and also commands (await ctx.send, await ctx.author.send, await ctx.message.delete())!
# Thanks to the developers of the cogs I added features to as it taught me how to make a cog! (Chessgame by WildStriker, Captcha by Kreusada, Speak by Epic guy and Rommer by Dav)
# Thanks to all the people who helped me with some commands in the #coding channel of the redbot support server!
