This is the cog guide for the 'AutoTraceback' cog. This guide contains the collection of commands which you can use in the cog.
Through this guide, ``[p]`` will always represent your prefix. Replace ``[p]`` with your own prefix when you use these commands in Discord.

.. note::

    Ensure that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update autotraceback``.

Here are all the commands included in this cog (1):

* ``[p]traceback [public=True]``

Installation
------------

If you haven't added my repo before, lets add it first. We'll call it
"AAA3A-cogs" here.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]repo add AAA3A-cogs https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/AAA3A-cogs

Now, we can install AutoTraceback.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]cog install AAA3A-cogs autotraceback

Once it's installed, it is not loaded by default. Load it by running the following command:

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]load autotraceback
