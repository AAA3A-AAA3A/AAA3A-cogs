    Ensure that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update ctxvar``.
    If there is something missing, or something that needs improving in this documentation, feel free to create an issue `here <https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/AAA3A-cogs/issues>`_.

Installation

If you haven't added my repo before, lets add it first. We'll call it "AAA3A-cogs" here.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]repo add AAA3A-cogs https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/AAA3A-cogs

Now, we can install CtxVar.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]cog install AAA3A-cogs ctxvar

Once it's installed, it is not loaded by default. Load it by running the following command:
