Installation
------------

If you haven't added my repo before, lets add it first. We'll call it "AAA3A-cogs" here.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]repo add AAA3A-cogs https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/AAA3A-cogs

Now, we can install Seen.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]cog install AAA3A-cogs seen

Once it's installed, it is not loaded by default. Load it by running the following command:

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]load seen
