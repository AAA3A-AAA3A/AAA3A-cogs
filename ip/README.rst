contains the collection of commands which you can use in the cog.
Through this guide, ``[p]`` will always represent your prefix. Replace
``[p]`` with your own prefix when you use these commands in Discord.
.. note::
    Ensure that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update ip``.
If there is something missing, or something that needs improving
